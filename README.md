# Discord Theater Server Bot

This is a Discord Bot that is being created for my friend's Discord server.

## Feature

* Messages the server at 12:00pm EST every Tuesday saying "React to this message by tonight if you're watching (insert movie title from playing next) this Wednesday at 8pm!"
* Messages a similar reminder 1 hour before, 30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, and when the movie time starts.

## TO DO

* Add a -playing-next command to see what the next movie on the list is
* Add a -remind-me command to DM user about when the next movie is

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo to download all the code in this project.
2. Paste the TOKEN of your Discord Bot in the `.env` file next to `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`. If you don't have a Discord Bot set up, you can watch [this video by CodeLyon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_sD9udZnCk) for how to set one up.
3. Run the command `node .` to start the Discord bot.
4. ???
5. Profit :)
